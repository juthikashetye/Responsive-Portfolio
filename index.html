            <p>Hi, I'm Juthika. I was born at a very young age. My hobbies are breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I'm an especially gifted napper. My laziness is like the number 8, once I lie down it’s infinite. My world revolves around WiFi, food and a cozy bed. I’m not lazy, I’m on energy-saving mode.</p>
            <p>I'm a living proof that nobody’s perfect. My life is about as organized as a $5 DVD bin at Walmart.
               I’m not sure how many problems I have, because Math is one of them.
            </p>
            <p>I’m an aspiring grown-up, professional procrastinator and a caffeine-dependent life form. I’m not actually funny. I’m just really mean and people think I’m joking. God is really creative. I mean, just look at me. Without me it would just be aweso. Life would be so boring without me.</p>
