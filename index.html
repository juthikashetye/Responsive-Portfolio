            <p>Hi, I am Juthika and I love making websites! I’m currently learning Full Stack Web Development.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>But, I wasn't always Coding for a living. After working as a Middle School teacher for a few years, a series of interesting events inspired me to get into coding, and since then I’m simply hooked onto it! I taught myself the fundamentals of web development and built my first ever website for a family member. This motivated me to pursue my passion for coding and make a career as a Web Developer.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>When I’m not coding, I love to go hiking, cooking and eating my way through the places I visit. In my spare time, I follow the Rifle Shooting sport and have myself represented India at International level.
            </p>
